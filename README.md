## 🔍 Detailed Project Showcases

### 🧬 [1. Biomedical Image Classification (MedMNIST)](https://github.com/PUIZCHONG/AMLS_24_25_SN24055149)
A comprehensive study on medical image diagnosis using the MedMNIST suite, covering both binary (BreastMNIST) and multi-class (BloodMNIST) scenarios.  
**Key Innovation:**  
- Implemented a Hybrid Architecture where a Deep CNN acts as a feature extractor for a downstream SVM, outperforming end-to-end deep learning on small medical datasets.  
**Performance:**  
- Achieved 95.3% accuracy on BloodMNIST using an ensemble of CNN-extracted features and probability weighting.  
**Visualization:**  
- Used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize decision boundaries in high-dimensional feature spaces.

### ✍️ [2. NBME - Score Clinical Patient Notes (NLP)](https://github.com/PUIZCHONG/DLNLP_assignment_25_24055149)
A Kaggle-based competition project focused on identifying clinical concepts within patient history notes.  
**Key Innovation:**  
- Developed a robust character-level span detection pipeline.  
- Solved the critical challenge of Offset Correction—maintaining label integrity after text standardization (e.g., expanding medical abbreviations like "htn" to "hypertension").  
**Advanced Techniques:**  
- Utilized Adversarial Training (FGM) and Focal Loss to handle class imbalance and improve model generalization on unstructured text.  
**Backbone:**  
- Fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

### 🤖 [3. GENIE Skill Policy Training (RL & World Models)](https://github.com/PUIZCHONG/ELEC0054_final)
This project extends JAFAR (an open-source reimplementation of Google's Genie) to train skill policies (
π
θ
) within generative interactive environments.  
**Key Innovation:**  
- Implemented a Three-Stage Training Pipeline:  
  1. **KL Distillation** for initial policy alignment.  
  2. **Weighted Behavioral Cloning (WBC)** for high-quality trajectory imitation.  
  3. **RL Fine-tuning** for end-to-end reward optimization.  
**Framework:**  
- Entirely built on JAX for high-performance hardware acceleration.  
**Metrics:**  
- Evaluated using perceptual metrics (SSIM, PSNR) and video quality metrics (FVD).

### 🍃 [4. Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://github.com/PUIZCHONG/AMLS_II_assignment24_25)
An automated system for diagnosing cassava plant diseases to support global food security.  
**Key Innovation:**  
- Developed a Dual-Model Ensemble combining EfficientNetB4 (global context) and CropNet (local texture details).  
**Explainable AI (XAI):**  
- Integrated Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight the specific regions of a leaf that triggered a "diseased" classification, providing transparency for agricultural experts.  
**Pipeline:**  
- Includes a full EDA suite for RGB distribution analysis and data augmentation impact studies.
